   <h3>Regular expressions</h3>
   <br>
   <p>Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions. It provides a brief overview of each syntax element. For a detailed explanation of each one's semantics, read the regular expressions reference.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Creating a regular expression</h3>
   <br>
   <img id="arrowB" src="arrow.jpg" onclick="scrollup()">
   <p>You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:

    Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:
    
    const re = /ab+c/;</p>
    <p>Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.

Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:
const re = new RegExp("ab+c");
</p>

<p>Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.</p>

<h3>Writing a regular expression pattern</h3>
<p>A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as /abc/, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as /ab*c/ or /Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/. The last example includes parentheses, which are used as a memory device. The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use, as described in Using groups.</p>
<h3>Using simple patterns</h3>
<p>Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match. For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character combinations in strings only when the exact sequence "abc" occurs (all characters together and in that order). Such a match would succeed in the strings "Hi, do you know your abc's?" and "The latest airplane designs evolved from slabcraft.". In both cases the match is with the substring "abc". There is no match in the string "Grab crab" because while it contains the substring "ab c", it does not contain the exact substring "abc".</p>
